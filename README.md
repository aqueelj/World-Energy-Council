Analysis of public opinion on climate change

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of people regarding climate change and energy transition that we are experiencing today to derive 
insights regarding the steps that can be taken to inform the masses better. This will help the World Energy Council shape their strategy for 
different regions depending upon the public opinion there.

There are two parts in this repository:
The first part consists of an ipython Notebook with sentiment analysis of twitter data using different ML models to classify the sentiment as negative or positive. This 
classification will help find the topics that are viewed positively or negatively in different regions.

The second part consists of an R markdown/Word Document with some visualizations. Here google search trends data has been visualized for different
regions which tells us the popularity of different keywords in different parts of the globe.
